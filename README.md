# What are GCODE Parser and Shaper
***GCode-Shaper-Parser*** aims to provide students an useful tool for understanding and practicing with G-code, a programming language for CNC machines:
- ***GCODE Parser*** is the main compiler developed for parsing G-code language and provide a graphical representation of the written code.
- ***Shaper*** is a metalanguage built upon G-code in order to simplify the definition of CNC commands and help the users understand the rules of G-code language.

Both GCODE Parser and Shaper are written in Java using ANTLR package.</br>
[GCode-Shaper-IDE](https://github.com/Team-di-Sviluppo-UniSIR/GCode-Shaper-Parser/releases/tag/v1.0) is a GUI developed for helping users in the usage of *GCode-Shaper-Parser*.
